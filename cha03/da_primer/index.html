              Tired of your dog giving you that look, but having no idea what
              they want? Do they really need to go outside, or are they just
              judging your Netflix binge-watching habits? Stop guessing and
              start knowing with the WoofWhisperer! This revolutionary, ahem,
              "device," is a tiny collar attachment that uses our proprietary
              "Bark-o-Meter" technology to translate your dog's barks, whines,
              and assorted grunts into hilariously relatable human speech.
