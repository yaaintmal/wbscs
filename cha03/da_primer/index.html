              Tired of your dog giving you that look, but having no idea what
              they want? Do they really need to go outside, or are they just
              judging your Netflix binge-watching habits? Stop guessing and
              start knowing with the WoofWhisperer! This revolutionary, ahem,
              "device," is a tiny collar attachment that uses our proprietary
              "Bark-o-Meter" technology to translate your dog's barks, whines,
              and assorted grunts into hilariously relatable human speech.

            This feature provides insight into their mood, helping you tell the

        The Bark Translator to demystify every "woof," the Emotion Analyzer to
        decode every side-eye, and Voice Packs to give your dog the personality
        they truly deserve (because let's be honest, they're not just a dog,
        they're a diva). With WoofWhisperer, you're not just getting an app;
        you're getting a permanent seat at the dinner table for all your dog's
        passive-aggressive complaints.

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>The "Paw-parazzi" Mode:</h3>
          <p>
            This feature adds an advanced, AI-powered photo editor to the app.
            It automatically edits your dog's photos, giving them tiny
            sunglasses, a fluffy scarf, or even a miniature tiara, all while
            smoothing out their fur to look perfectly groomed. The app then
            generates a fictional celebrity gossip headline for the photo, like
            "Is Fido Feuding with the Mailman Again?"
          </p>
          <div class="randominfobox1-2">
            Price: This feature costs "One Exasperated Sigh and a Lifetime of
            Guilt", which we'll value at $9.99 per month.
          </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>The "Puppy-to-Parent" Text Translator:</h3>
          <p>
            This feature takes the "Bark-to-Text" idea a step further. Instead
            of just a text message, it translates your dog's barks into full,
            passive-aggressive text messages that they'd theoretically send to
            you. A series of happy tail wags might become, "Just so you know,
            the mailman came by again and you were too busy on the couch to
            notice. I saved us all from the threat, you're welcome."
          </p>
          <div class="randominfobox1-2">
            Price: A one-time purchase of "Three Belly Rubs and a Squeaky Toy",

        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <h3>The "Secret Agent Sniffer" Protocol:</h3>
          <p>
            This upgrade turns the emotion analyzer into a high-tech "detection"
            mode. You input a picture of a suspicious squirrel or a neighbor's
            cat, and the app's AI analyzes your dog's barks and tail wags to
            create a detailed mission report on their location, movements, and
            potential motives.
          </p>
          <div class="randominfobox1-2">
            Price: We're calling this one the "Squirrel Reconnaissance Fee," a
