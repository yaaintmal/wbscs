              Tired of your dog giving you that look, but having no idea what
              they want? Do they really need to go outside, or are they just
              judging your Netflix binge-watching habits? Stop guessing and
              start knowing with the WoofWhisperer! This revolutionary, ahem,
              "device," is a tiny collar attachment that uses our proprietary
              "Bark-o-Meter" technology to translate your dog's barks, whines,
              and assorted grunts into hilariously relatable human speech.

        The Bark Translator to demystify every "woof," the Emotion Analyzer to
        decode every side-eye, and Voice Packs to give your dog the personality
        they truly deserve (because let's be honest, they're not just a dog,
        they're a diva). With WoofWhisperer, you're not just getting an app;

          <h3>The "Paw-parazzi" Mode:</h3>
          <p>
            This feature adds an advanced, AI-powered photo editor to the app.
            It automatically edits your dog's photos, giving them tiny
            sunglasses, a fluffy scarf, or even a miniature tiara, all while
            smoothing out their fur to look perfectly groomed. The app then
            generates a fictional celebrity gossip headline for the photo, like
            "Is Fido Feuding with the Mailman Again?"
          </p>
          <div class="randominfobox1-2">
            Price: This feature costs "One Exasperated Sigh and a Lifetime of
            Guilt", which we'll value at $9.99 per month.

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>The "Puppy-to-Parent" Text Translator:</h3>
          <p>
            This feature takes the "Bark-to-Text" idea a step further. Instead
            of just a text message, it translates your dog's barks into full,
            passive-aggressive text messages that they'd theoretically send to
            you. A series of happy tail wags might become, "Just so you know,
            the mailman came by again and you were too busy on the couch to
            notice. I saved us all from the threat, you're welcome."
          </p>
          <div class="randominfobox1-2">
            Price: A one-time purchase of "Three Belly Rubs and a Squeaky Toy",
            which translates to $9.99.

        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <h3>The "Secret Agent Sniffer" Protocol:</h3>
          <p>
            This upgrade turns the emotion analyzer into a high-tech "detection"
            mode. You input a picture of a suspicious squirrel or a neighbor's
            cat, and the app's AI analyzes your dog's barks and tail wags to
            create a detailed mission report on their location, movements, and
            potential motives.
          </p>
          <div class="randominfobox1-2">
            Price: We're calling this one the "Squirrel Reconnaissance Fee," a
