        <h2>Why Choose ChronoVoyages?</h2>
        <p>
          We're not your grandma's travel agency. Unless your grandma is a
          time-traveling physicist, in which case, she'd probably love us. We
          specialize in bespoke temporal tours, ensuring you get a front-row
          seat to history—without accidentally becoming a part of it.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong> See the dinosaurs.</strong> From a safe,
            totally-not-going-to-be-eaten distance. Our Temporal Shields are a
            work of art.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Witness the pyramids being built.</strong> Watch the
            greatest architectural marvels take shape, and finally get an answer
            to all those alien theories. (Spoiler alert: it's just really good
            planning).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Catch a concert by your favorite historical figure.</strong>
            Ever wanted to see Shakespeare perform his latest sonnets live? Now
            you can! Just don't ask him for an autograph—he doesn't know what a
            pen is yet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Experience the future.</strong> Well, we can't actually do
            that yet. We're still working on the whole "stable paradox-free
            forward jump" thing. We'll let you know.

      <h2>Our Guarantee</h2>
      <p>
        We guarantee you'll have an unforgettable time. We also guarantee you
        won't change the past, create any paradoxes, or accidentally delete your
        own existence. Our Temporal Integrity Specialists are the best in the
        business, trained to handle everything from a misplaced historical
        artifact to a temporal ripple caused by a rogue butterfly.

        So, what are you waiting for? Your adventure is waiting... and it's
